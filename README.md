# Work-with-Soilspec-Data
Here is the code I used for a chain of posts in my blog (nir-quimiometria.blogspot.com) about the NIR analysis of soil spectra.
The file "soilspec.R" show the details to load the files we need to start the code with the tutorials.

Tutorial start with the file "Soilspec_part1.Rmd", where we can see the raw spectra and to treat it with several math treatments. 
    We see also play attention to the Y matrix, and the position of the spectra in the principal components wavelength space.
    There are other Rmd files which are similar to this one.
